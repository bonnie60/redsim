# redsim
#### Redstone Simulator in python
##### Current features:
Blocks, Torches and Dust
Dust tracks its direction
Can render any layer to a image array, or .gif
##### To-do:
Add a tick system so that redstone dust conducts instantly and Torches take 1 tick to update
This has highest priority, because repeaters depend on it.

Add repeaters
